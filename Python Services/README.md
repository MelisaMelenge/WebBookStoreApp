# Web_book_store
This repository hosts the documentation, code, paper, technical report and poster on the web bookstore project.

## Introduction 
This project involves the development of a virtual book store, implemented using **Object Oriented Programming** principles and design patterns**. The main objective is to offer a simple and intuitive platform that allows users to search, add to cart and buy books, as well as administrators to manage the catalog of available products. The project is designed to be scalable and efficient, making use of modern technologies and good practices in software development.

## Business Model 
This business model is characterized by offering users (buyers) a wide range of products (books) that they can browse, search and buy efficiently. The purchasing process is done through a shopping cart, where the customer can manage the books they wish to purchase and proceed to place the order. In parallel, the application has an administrative functionality that allows sellers or administrators to manage the book catalog.
